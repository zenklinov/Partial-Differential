    "## The Linear Method\n",
    "The **Linear Method** refers to a shooting technique for solving linear two-point **boundary value problems** (BVPs) by exploiting the superposition principle. It applies to linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of second order (or higher) with boundary conditions specified at two different points. Because the differential equation is linear (no products or powers of the unknown function and its derivatives), any linear combination of solutions is also a solution. This property allows us to construct the general solution by combining independent particular solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, one starts by solving the homogeneous form of the ODE twice, using two convenient sets of initial conditions at the left boundary. For example, suppose we have a second‑order linear ODE $y'' = p(x)\\,y' + q(x)\\,y + r(x)$ with boundary conditions $y(a)=\\alpha$ and $y(b)=\\beta$. We can solve two IVPs on $[a,b]$: one for $y_1(x)$ with $y_1(a)=\\alpha$ and $y_1'(a)=0$, and another for $y_2(x)$ with $y_2(a)=0$ and $y_2'(a)=1$. These produce two linearly independent solution profiles. By linearity, the general solution can be written as $y(x)=y_1(x)+C\\,y_2(x)$, where $C=\\dfrac{\\beta-y_1(b)}{y_2(b)}$ is chosen so $y(b)=\\beta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The linear shooting method is efficient because it requires only two integrations (for $y_1$ and $y_2$) and a single algebraic computation for $C$. No iterative guessing is needed due to the linear relationship between the initial slope and the final value. **For example**, consider the steady‑state temperature profile along a rod of length $L$ with fixed temperatures at both ends. The governing equation may take the linear form $T''(x)=0$ with $T(0)=T_0$ and $T(L)=T_L$. Using the linear method, one integrates two IVPs and linearly combines them to match $T_L$, recovering the exact linear temperature distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Another application** is in structural engineering when computing beam deflections. The deflection $y(x)$ of a beam under load satisfies $EI\\,y''(x)=q(x)$ with boundary conditions determined by supports. The linear method lets engineers shoot from one end and directly obtain the deflection curve that meets the boundary condition at the other end, providing insight into displacement under loading.\n"

    "## The Shooting Method for Nonlinear Problems\n",
    "The **Shooting Method for Nonlinear Problems** is a numerical technique to solve nonlinear boundary value problems by transforming them into initial value problems with unknown initial conditions. Because the relationship between the missing initial slope and the endpoint value is **nonlinear**, we must iterate to find the correct initial slope that satisfies the boundary condition at the right boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a second‑order ODE $y'' = f(x,y,y')$ with conditions $y(a)=A$ and $y(b)=B$. We treat the unknown initial derivative $y'(a)$ as a parameter $s$. Solving the IVP with initial data $y(a)=A$, $y'(a)=s$ yields a solution $y(x;s)$. We then define $F(s)=y(b;s)-B$ and seek $s^*$ such that $F(s^*)=0$. Because $F$ is nonlinear, we update $s$ using a root‑finding scheme like bisection, secant, or Newton’s method, recomputing the IVP at each iteration until convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each iteration requires integrating the IVP, typically with a Runge–Kutta integrator. Although computationally expensive, the method is conceptually simple and flexible. **For example**, finding the launch angle that allows a projectile to hit a specific target under quadratic air drag involves a nonlinear ODE system. The shooting parameter can be the initial angle; iterative adjustment via secant method yields the correct trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another classic example is the **Blasius boundary‑layer equation**, a third‑order nonlinear ODE describing laminar flow over a flat plate. By guessing the missing wall‑derivative and iterating with the shooting method, one obtains the velocity profile satisfying the far‑field boundary condition at infinity. Thus, the method is widely used in physics and engineering wherever “aim‑and‑adjust” boundary problems arise.\n"

    "## The Rayleigh–Ritz Method\n",
    "The **Rayleigh–Ritz Method** is an approximate variational technique that converts a boundary value problem into an optimization problem for an energy‑like functional. We assume the unknown solution can be approximated by a finite set of trial functions that satisfy essential boundary conditions, and then choose coefficients that make the functional stationary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the problem derives from minimizing a functional $J[y]$ (e.g., total potential energy). We approximate the solution by $y_N(x)=\\sum_{i=1}^N a_i\\,\\phi_i(x)$, where $\\phi_i$ are chosen basis functions and $a_i$ are unknowns. Substituting into $J$ gives $J(a_1,\\dots,a_N)$. The Rayleigh–Ritz criterion requires $\\partial J/\\partial a_i = 0$ for all $i$, yielding a system of algebraic equations for the coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because many physical problems lead to quadratic functionals, the resulting equations are linear, making computation straightforward. As $N$ increases, $y_N$ converges to the true solution provided the trial space is rich enough. **In quantum mechanics**, the variational method for estimating ground‑state energies is precisely Rayleigh–Ritz: minimize the expected energy $\\langle\\psi|H|\\psi\\rangle$ over normalized trial wavefunctions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In **structural engineering**, Rayleigh–Ritz approximates vibration modes and natural frequencies. Engineers assume a plausible deflection shape for a beam, plug it into the strain‑energy functional, and solve for the amplitude coefficients that minimize energy, yielding an approximate mode shape and eigenfrequency. Similar strategies estimate critical buckling loads or plate deflections, and the philosophy underpins the finite element method.\n"

    "## Euler’s Method\n",
    "**Euler’s Method** is the simplest explicit integrator for the initial value problem $y' = f(x,y)$ with $y(x_0)=y_0$. Given a step size $h$, the update formula\n",
    "$$y_{n+1}=y_n + h\\,f(x_n,y_n)$$\n",
    "advances the solution by extrapolating with the derivative at the beginning of the interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Euler’s method is **first‑order accurate**: the global error scales as $O(h)$, so halving $h$ roughly halves the error. Because it uses only one slope sample per step, it ignores curvature and can be inaccurate unless $h$ is very small. It is also conditionally stable; for stiff equations it demands prohibitively small $h$ to avoid divergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these limitations, Euler’s method is pedagogically valuable and serves as the foundation for more sophisticated schemes. **For instance**, integrating the exponential decay ODE $y'=-2y$ from $t=0$ with $h=0.1$ provides a discrete approximation to the exact solution $y(t)=y_0 e^{-2t}$. The method is also used for quick prototyping; a rough projectile simulation with drag can be coded in minutes using Euler steps before upgrading to higher‑order methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many numerical libraries, Euler’s method is included mainly as a reference implementation or as the first stage of a composite integrator (e.g., Heun’s or RK methods). Understanding its errors and stability properties gives insight into why higher‑order algorithms like Runge–Kutta are preferred for serious scientific computation.\n"

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "RK4 has local truncation error $O(h^5)$ and global error $O(h^4)$, a vast improvement over Euler’s $O(h)$. Because RK methods are **self‑starting** and relatively simple to code, they have become the default choice in many scientific and engineering applications. Adaptive RK schemes (e.g., Dormand–Prince) adjust $h$ on the fly to meet user‑specified error tolerances.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications abound.** In celestial mechanics, RK4 reliably integrates planetary orbits under Newtonian gravity for thousands of periods. In electrical engineering, it solves the nonlinear differential equations governing RLC circuits during transients. Physics engines for video games often use RK integrators to animate rigid‑body dynamics, ensuring smooth and realistic motion without excessive computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implicit RK variants and embedded error estimates further extend the method’s reach to stiff systems and high‑accuracy requirements. Consequently, the RK family is a cornerstone of modern numerical ODE solving, balancing accuracy, robustness, and computational effort.\n"
